Laszlo corrected this, but unfortunately it was too late to make it into 0.3.0.  There will probably be a 0.3.1 soon though.

The problem is I used PRIO_MIN, I should have used PRIO_MAX for the lowest priority.  The OS isn't supposed to let you increase priority, so the PRIO_MIN ought to leave it at priority 0.
