. Perhaps it has to do with my connection's very high latency (2000ms or more on average)

2 seconds of latency in both directions should reduce your generation success by less than 1%.

and/or my high packet loss (sometimes up to 10% loss)?

Probably OK, but I'm not sure.  The protocol is designed to resync to the next message, and messages get re-requested from all the other nodes you're connected to until received.  If you miss a block, it'll also keep requesting it every time another blocks comes in and it sees there's a gap.  Before the original release I did a test dropping 1 out of 4 random messages under heavy load until I could run it overnight without any nodes getting stuck.</code></pre></div></div>
