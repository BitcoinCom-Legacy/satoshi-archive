Post your static IP
February 21, 2010, 04:19:53 AM	

It would be nice to have a list of static IPs for new users to send test donations to so they can see how the software works.  If you can accept incoming connections and you have a static IP address, post it here!

Anything sent to these IPs should be considered a donation.  

If you do request a round-trip, be sure to include your return bitcoin address or IP in the comment, but please assume it'll be one-way.  They won't necessarily be watching for incoming transactions to send back.
