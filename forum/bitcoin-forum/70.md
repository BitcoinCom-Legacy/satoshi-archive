   On Linux it needs libgtk2.0-0 installed

Will this requirement be removed sometime? I'd rather not have to deal with GTK.

How much "dealing with" does GTK actually require?  Is it just a matter of "sudo apt-get install libgtk2.0-0" and having some extra libraries sitting around?  GTK doesn't have to do anything, just be there for bitcoin to link to when it loads up, have the gtk-init-check call fail because no GUI present, then it's done. 

It saves us butchering everything with ifdefs and a separate compile and binary to use wxBase just to try to avoid linking GTK.
