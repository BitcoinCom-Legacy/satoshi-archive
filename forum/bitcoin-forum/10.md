[OLD THREAD] Bitcoin version 0.2 development status
November 27, 2009, 10:48:39 PM	

We've been working hard on improvements for the next version release.  Martti (sirius-m) added some nice features to make it more user friendly and easier to run in the background:
 - Minimize to system tray option
 - Autostart on boot option so you can keep it running in the background automatically
 - New options dialog layout
 - Setup EXE for Windows, in addition to the archive download

I've been working on a number of refinements to the networking code and laying the groundwork for future functionality.  Also coming in version 0.2:
 - Multi-processor support for coin generation
 - Proxy support
```
