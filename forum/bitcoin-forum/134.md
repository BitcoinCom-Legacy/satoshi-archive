-------------
It would be nice if the listtransactions RPC method were finished before the next release, though.

My fear is too many programmers would latch onto that for checking for received payments.  It can never be reliable that way.  The list/getreceivedbyaddress/label functions are the only way to do it reliably.

We shouldn't delay forever until every possible feature is done.  There's always going to be one more thing to do.</code></pre></div></div>
