The next thing for v0.1.6 is to take advantage of multiple
processors to generate blocks. Currently it only starts one
thread. If you have a multi-core processor like a Core Duo or
Quad this will double or quadruple your production.

Later I want to add interfaces to make it really easy to integrate
into websites from any server side language.
