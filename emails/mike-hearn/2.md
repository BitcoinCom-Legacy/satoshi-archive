Right.  I'm trying to think of more clear wording for that, maybe "%d network blocks" or "%d block chain".

For the actual risk, multiply the 0.1% by the probability that the buyer is an attacker with a huge network of computers.

For micropayments, you can safely accept the payment immediately.  The size of the payment is too small for the effort to steal it. Micropayments are almost always for intellectual property, where there's no physical loss to the merchant.  Anyone trying to steal a micropayment would probably not be a paying customer anyway, and if they want to steal intellectual property they can use the file sharing networks.

Currently, businesses accept a certain chargeoff rate.  I believe the risk with 1 or even 0 confirming blocks will be much less than the rate of chargebacks on verified credit card transactions.

The usual scam against a merchant that doesn't wait for confirming blocks would be to send a payment to a merchant, then quickly try to propagate a double-spend to the network before the merchant's copy. What the merchant can do is broadcast his transaction and then monitor the network for any double-spend copies.  The thief would not be able to broadcast during the monitoring period or else the merchant's node would receive a copy.  The merchant would only have to monitor for a minute or two until most of the network nodes have his version and it's too late for the thief's version to catch up and reach many nodes.  With just a minute or two delay, the chance of getting away without paying could be made much too low to scam.  A thief usually needs a high probability of getting an item for free to make it worthwhile.  Using a lot of CPU power to do the brute force attack discussed in the paper in addition to the above scam would not increase the thief's chances very much.

Anything that grants access to something, like something that takes a while to download, access to a website, web hosting, a subscription or service, can be cancelled a few minutes later if the transaction is rejected.

The keyspace is huge, 2^256.  The thing being hashed includes the node's public key and a random nonce, so the chance of any two nodes duplicating work on the same space is negligible.

It's not communicated.  The formula is hardcoded in the program and every node does the same calculation to know what difficulty is required for the next block.  If someone diverged from the formula, their block would not be accepted by the majority.

No problem, thanks for testing it on Mac Wine.
