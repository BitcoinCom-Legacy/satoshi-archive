```
Version 0.3.18 is now available.

Changes:
- Fixed a wallet.dat compatibility problem if you downgraded from 0.3.17
and then upgraded again
- IsStandard() check to only include known transaction types in blocks
- Jgarzik's optimisation to speed up the initial block download a little

The main addition in this release is the Accounts-based JSON-RPC
commands that Gavin's been working on (more details at
http://www.bitcoin.org/smf/index.php?topic=1886.0).
- getaccountaddress
- sendfrom
- move
- getbalance
- listtransactions
