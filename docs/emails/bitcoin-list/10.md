I haven't had any reports of crashes in v0.1.5. It's been rock solid
for me on Windows. I think it must be Wine related. If you get another
crash in Wine and it prints anything on the terminal, e-mail me and I
may be able to figure out what happened, maybe something I can work
around. Martti and I have been working on a new version to release soon
and it would be nice to get any Wine fixes in there.

Those don't look like anything to worry about. Probably functions
unimplemented by Wine that are harmlessly stubbed out.

You can delete debug.log occasionally if you don't want to take the disk
space. It's just status messages that help with debugging.

bitcoin.sourceforge.net looks fine now. Maybe sourceforge was doing
some maintenance.
