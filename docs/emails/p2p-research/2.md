It's similar in that it uses digital signatures for coins, but different 
in the approach to privacy and preventing double-spending.  The 
recipient of a Bitcoin payment is able to check whether it is the first 
spend or not, and second-spends are not accepted.  There isn't an 
off-line mode where double-spenders are caught and shamed after the 
fact, because that would require participants to have identities.

To protect privacy, key pairs are used only once, with a new one for 
every transaction.  The owner of a coin is just whoever has its private key.

Of course, the biggest difference is the lack of a central server.  That 
was the Achilles heel of Chaumian systems; when the central company shut 
down, so did the currency.

There is a limited supply of money.  Circulation will be 21,000,000 
coins.  Transactions only transfer ownership.

Thank you for your questions,
