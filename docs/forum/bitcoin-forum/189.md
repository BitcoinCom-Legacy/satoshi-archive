Bitcoin 0.3.1 released
July 15, 2010, 05:05:54 PM	

This is a bugfix maintenance release.  It is now uploaded to SourceForge.  Mac OS X didn't need any fixes so we don't really need to update it, 0.3.0 is still good.

The download links are on bitcoin.org

Changes:
- Added Portuguese translation by Tiago Faria
Windows
- Fix for 22DbRunRecoveryException if your username has non-ascii characters in it
Linux
- Laszlo's fix for lowering generate thread to lowest priority
- Fix for if you're having trouble with libcrypto linkage
- Gavin Andresen's implementation of "start on windowing system startup" option
```
